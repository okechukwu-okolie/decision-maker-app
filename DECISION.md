1. Important
Definition; Activities that contribute to your high-level mission, your values, and your high-priority goals. Importance is defined by your Compass: it is what moves the needle in your life or career over the long term.

Simple Example; Spending an hour planning your business strategy for the next year. It doesn't have to be done today, but it is vital for your future success.

2. Urgent
Definition: Activities that require immediate attention. These are visible, "in your face," and usually associated with the Clock. They press on us and insist on action, often because of someone else’s timeline or a looming deadline.

Simple Example: A phone call ringing right now or an email marked "ASAP" from a colleague.

3. Not Important
Definition: Activities that do not contribute to your own mission or long-term goals. We often mistake these for being important simply because they are urgent or because they are "popular" (things everyone else is doing).

Simple Example: Attending a meeting you were invited to where you have no contribution to make and nothing to learn, but you go just because it’s on the calendar.

4. Not Urgent
Definition: Activities that have no immediate deadline or "press" for your time. These can be the most dangerous because they are easy to procrastinate (if they are important) or easy to get lost in (if they are unimportant).

Simple Example: Sorting through your junk mail folder or mindlessly scrolling through a social media feed.
